# Word-Masters(training)

"HTML, CSS, JS Practice. The application is a primitive replica of the game 'Wordle'. The program utilizes pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - without external libraries.
The application is not perfect:

- So far, I have found several errors that should not occur in 'Wordle'.
- The code itself is not perfect either, and the solutions implemented can be replaced with other, more understandable and simplified mechanisms.
  
However, the aim of the program is learning, practicing Frontend mechanisms, testing different approaches, and seeking various solutions to the same problems."
